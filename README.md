## Hardware Features

### Mainboard

The hardware is designed around a custom 4-layer mainboard. This PCB integrates the ESP32 microcontroller, connections for peripherals, interface components, and all power management circuitry for the project.

### Power Architecture

The system is powered by a single 18650 lithium-ion battery. A charging IC, the TP4056 provides battery charging capability. The battery is connected to the system via a solid-state soft power-switch circuit. This functions similar to the soft power switch on a laptop, and similarly allows the device to shut itself down if the battery's state-of-charge drops too low. This is important because over-discharging a lithium-ion can cause damage to the cell, permanently reducing the usable capacity.

When operating from battery, the main 5V rail is generated by a DC-DC converter. The LEDs operate directly from 5V.\

## Software

A majority of the software is implemented through the [esp32-utilities](https://github.com/Blake-Ballew/esp32-utilities) library. This library interfaces with all of the hardware components of the device.
